# MarketingScrape
Python

Market research, web scraping ~12,000 pages
I'm new to scraping and wanted to get into the details
Some things are inefficient like file opening/closing, as I was worried about saving data while traffic was throttled and I was temp. banned

I've removed the site name.

Due to traffic throttling/ temp. banning, I found it easiest to download all pages and later analyze them.

To do it again I'd use Python's scrappy
